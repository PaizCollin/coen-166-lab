normalize data so that they are of the same dimension

define row and col count to display figures

create a subplot to put the figures in
while loop to go through and pick one of each figure type, add it to the subplot
then we show the subplot

create the model
sequential because we have linear stack of layers (input)
flatten the input into a 1-D array of data, input shape(28,28) b/c each figure is 28x28
512 output nodes, ReLU activation
last layer has 10 nodes because there are 10 different types of classes, with a activiation func of softmax

compile model using this loss function

train model using model.fit by giving it training sets (sets epochs and batch_size)

evaluate the model and get the error as well as the accuracy, using the test samples and the trained model
print the loss rate and accuracy rate from the test

calculate the prediction probability using the test set
