## Overview

#### This repository includes various Python projects from the lab section of COEN 166: Artificial Intelligence.

## Lab 1 - Python Practice

#### Get started with the basics of Python.

## Lab 2 - Vacuum Cleaner Agent

#### Implement a Vacuum cleaner agent based on the provided figure.

## Lab 3 - Search

#### Use the Pacman AI project developed at UC Berkeley to implement various search algorithms.

## Lab 4 - Minimax game

#### Use the Pacman AI project developed at UC Berkeley to implement a minimax game.

## Lab 5 - Reinforcement Learning

#### Use the Pacman AI project developed at UC Berkeley to implement a Q-learning agent to walk in the grid world.

## Lab 6 - Neural Network

#### Build a two-layer neural network for image recognition with the fashion MNIST data set. The network has one hidden layer, and an output layer. The hidden layer has 512 nodes, and adopts the ReLU activation function; the output layer has 10 nodes, and adopts the softmax activation function to output the class probabilities. Use the “sparse_categorical_crossentropy” loss function, use ‘adam’ as the optimizer, use a batch size of 32, and train your model for 5 epochs.
